Code for eculver.io
-------------------

This is just the code that runs eculver.io, my personal blog and technical outlet for the things I may be playing around with.

Built with Django 1.3.1 and uses the following 3rd party apps:

    * [django-admin-tools](https://bitbucket.org/izi/django-admin-tools/)
    * [South](http://south.aeracode.org/)
    * [django-extensions](https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions)
    * [biblion] (https://github.com/eldarion/biblion)


And on the front-end:

    * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
    * [Sass](http://thesassway.com/)
    * [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
    * [Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/)


Feel free to use and modify.
